# RadioNanny
Android App

Application for noise control in a room. (For example, while little child sleep there).
If noise becomes to loud (child awaked and crying) app calls to the number from it settings.

Now app have some more functions, but I am not shure about them.
List of other functions:

1. Journal - Nanny can write on phone memory or CD card audio with all noises in the room.  (Not complited)

2. Recalling - Nanny can recall to the setting number, if it is miss while app was active. If user want to hear, what is going
on in the room by himself, he can add his number to the settings, call to the nanny number, in this case nanny recals him,
and user can hear romm by himself. (ready)

3. Low battary sms sender - if nanny phone has low battary it sends sms to the number from settings. (90% complited)

4. Sms senderwith missing number - if nanny phone misses call, and it it not in recall base, it just send sms about it. (This need
for people who use nanny on its own phones, and don't want to miss any calls)   (90% ready)

I am beginer in programming, so my code is not very good )))
Now I return to my app from 2/3 yaer pause, so I don't remember some thing in code.
App has a terrible UI, with default buttons, I have no Idea how to make it better, because i am not a desiner and can not draw at all.

I want to post that app on market 100% free and without adverts, just for portfolio.


WARNING:
If youy gona test if, DON'T play with sms senders, without code review, because it app able to sent a lot of sms in one second
and it will pay you some money.


Sorry for my English )))
